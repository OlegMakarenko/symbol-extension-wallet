    <h1>Privacy Policy for Symbol Wallet</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: May 17, 2024</p>
    <hr />


    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Welcome to Symbol Wallet. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy
        Policy outlines how Symbol Wallet collects, uses, and protects your information.</p>


    <h3>How Do You Accept This Policy</h3>

    <p>By using Symbol Wallet, including downloading one of our mobile applications or web-browser extension, you agree
        to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please review it carefully and ensure you understand how your data is
        managed and protected.</p>

    <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR TERMS OF USE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY OF THE
        SERVICES.</p>


    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Personal Data Stored Locally: Symbol Wallet stores sensitive personal data, including your mnemonic
            passphrase and account keys, locally on your device using the browser's local storage. This information is
            encrypted to enhance security.</li>
        <li>Automatic Data Collection: When you use Symbol Wallet, third-party services may automatically receive
            certain information through request headers, such as your IP address and user agent string. This data can
            potentially be used to track and identify you, although Symbol Wallet does not have control over this
            process.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Data Usage and Sharing</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Local Storage: Your mnemonic passphrase and private keys are stored in encrypted form in the browser's local
            storage on your device. This information is not shared with any third parties.</li>
        <li>Third-Party Information Access: Some personal information, such as your IP address and user agent string, is
            automatically sent to third-party services due to the nature of internet communications. Symbol Wallet does
            not have control over this data exchange.</li>
        <li>Blockchain Transactions: Symbol Wallet uses the Symbol Blockchain to process transactions. Information such
            as addresses, transaction amounts, and other details are publicly visible on the blockchain and can be
            accessed by anyone.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Security Measures</h3>

    <p>While we take measures to encrypt your sensitive data and store it securely, it is important to note that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Risk of Compromise: Encrypted data stored in your browser's local storage can be compromised by malicious
            software on your device, potentially leading to the loss of all your funds.</li>
        <li>Recommended Use: Symbol Wallet is not recommended for storing large amounts of funds. Use it cautiously and
            ensure your device is secure.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Data Recovery and Responsibility</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>No Data Recovery: Symbol Wallet does not store your mnemonic passphrase or private keys on any external
            servers. Therefore, it is impossible to recover access to your account if you lose your mnemonic passphrase.
        </li>
        <li>User Responsibility: Users are solely responsible for securely storing their mnemonic passphrase and private
            keys.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Public Data on Blockchain</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Visibility: All transactions made using Symbol Wallet are recorded on the Symbol Blockchain. Information
            such as addresses, transaction amounts, and other transaction details are publicly accessible and can be
            viewed by anyone.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated
        effective date.</p>
